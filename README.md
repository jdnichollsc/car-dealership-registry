# Car Dealership Registry 
This project is a Car Dealership Repair Shop Registry which tracks work done on cars.

# Problem Statement
Complete the instructions below. There are several unit tests that will help you to verify your solution.

1. Implement `Car.registerVisit` method which records a visit with a given mileage and type.
2. Implement `Car.visitsCount` method which returns total number of visits of this car.
3. Implement `Car.hasBeenOverhauled` method checking if the car has been ever overhauled.
4. Implement `Calculator.getLastKnownMileage` method which returns the last known car mileage.

# Hints
1. Donâ€™t assume that visits are registered chronologically. 
2. There is no possibility to roll back a car's mileage.
